# My Portfolio

> What about a summary of who I am?

I am **Victor Ohachor**, commonly known as OVECJOE on the internet. Several years ago, before I discovered the world of **Tech**, I was a teenager who simply loved books. I developed a passion for fiction around the age of 8 when a neighbor, who happened to be a librarian, noticed my love for books and lent me novels to devour. At the age of 10, a friend introduced me to comic writing, and after spending some time practicing, I began writing novellas, drawing, and creating comics.

I dreamed of becoming a fiction writer, particularly since I experienced significant success in writing during my teenage years (although I didn't market my work and lost all of it as I used physical books for writing). Both classmates and teachers praised the vividness of my imagination and how it enabled me to craft fictions like an adult. My aspiration was to change the world through my creative imagination.

Unfortunately, this dream quickly faded after the most exhilarating 3-4 years of my life spent writing. I had to confront the harsh realities of the real world at a very early stage as I sought to assist my parents in making ends meet.

Fast forward to 2024, I am currently a WordPress Plugin Developer at Plugli, essentially a software engineer, and simultaneously pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Kibo. After a short period (probably a month) of identity crisis following a 3-week illness at the beginning of the year, I rediscovered my childhood passion. What reignited my motivation was a single sentence from an old friend who had read some of my novellas and series: _"...The world needs your storiessss!"_

And here I am with a new brand:
> Crafting creative fictions that provide deep insights into various technologies for technical readers while expanding the creative and imaginative experience for all.

## Summary About Me

I am an individual who has fallen in love with building software and rediscovered a passion for fiction writing. Currently, I am seeking to merge these two worlds in my unique style. Consequently, I aim to expand my horizons within these realms and remain open to new information that can contribute to creating a more positive world.

## Projects 🧭

Below is a selected list of ongoing or completed projects I have collaborated on:

### Ongoing 🚧

Project Name | Description | Technologies | Open Source | My Role
------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------
**Birthmark** | A web automation tool that automatically sends birthday wishes to loved ones. It utilizes a background job to identify active birthdays for the upcoming day approximately 30 minutes before **00:00**. Subsequently, it organizes these birthdays into queues based on the modes of communication (SMS, Email, or Automated Call). Dedicated background tasks then handle these queues. | Nodejs, TypeScript, Jest, Pug | False | Mentor, Team Lead
**[Paige](https://github.com/Dev-Motion/paige)** | A space where you can customize your focus, immerse yourself in calm scenes, and find inspiration whenever you open a new tab in your browser. | TypeScript, React, Vite and more | True | Contributor
**[Prettyer](https://github.com/OVECJOE/prettyer)** | It was a small project created to demonstrate to a group of mentees how to transition from Vanilla JavaScript to React. This project involved forking a video player originally built from scratch using Vanilla JavaScript and adapting it into a Reactjs version. _May never be completed_ | Reactjs, JavaScript | False | Creator
**[Structlib](https://github.com/OVECJOE/structlib)** | A PHP library available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org), the new Composer repository. Due to PHP's limited and imperfect data structures, I developed this library which offers wrappers around the existing PHP data structures like `Array` and introduces additional data structures. ⚠️ However, please note that it is still in a state of disarray. | PHP, composer | True | Creator
**WP Block Parser** | A private Node.js library designed for parsing Gutenberg-based WordPress shortcodes. This library is specifically tailored to be used within a Nodejs API that integrates with a large WordPress plugin. | Nodejs, TypeScript | False | Creator

### Completed 🔚

Project Name | Description | Technologies | Open Source | My Role
------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------
**[PoetPiece](https:://ovecjoe.pythonanywhere.com/)** | A web application where I write and share my poems or poetic resources. | Python, Flask, JavaScript | False | Owner
**Sermonie** | A WordPress Plugin that offers a responsive admin page for seamlessly adding sermons through a custom POST type. Additionally, it facilitates the viewing and searching of sermons. The plugin also includes a shortcode, simplifying the process of adding an audio player for a sermon directly onto your WordPress page. It also provides a custom TinyMCE button that enables you to add a sermon's shortcode directly into your post. | PHP, WordPress, HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery | False | Freelancer

> Feel free to explore my public repositories. Although many of them are currently undocumented, I am actively working on enhancing the viewing experience by adding READMEs, refactoring code, introducing unit tests for those lacking them, and implementing various improvements.
