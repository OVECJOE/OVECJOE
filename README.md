## Featured Projects :star:
1. [Chiblogger](https://github.com/OVECJOE/chiblogger) &mdash; work in progress :construction:
   - A custom health fitness blogging application built as a gift to my aunt. MVP completed, but not yet deployed.
   - Built using the MERN stack.
   - [A short video to demonstrate responsiveness and UI](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/10762766?key=c0d722813449a6e3ccbb1a0c064a2f3b)
   - Live Demo | Very soon.
2. [KiddiePad API](https://github.com/OVECJOE/kiddiepad_api) &mdash; first version deployed :shipit:
   - This was my final portfolio project at ALX Holberton. I utilized Nodejs, MongoDB, and Express.
   - I didn't know anything about these technologies at that time, but I had to learn and implement it in the project within 2 weeks.
   - I am proud of this project.
   - To learn more about it and its future, check out the powerpoint slides for the [pitch](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AiTanVehGkLplA52ckzzHPG8LgW7?e=egQ8UA) and the [project presentation](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AiTanVehGkLplBaplOlFmbbVBRDo?e=1jdso0).
   - [Live Demo](https://kiddiepad-api.herokuapp.com/api-docs)
3. [portCraft](https://github.com/OVECJOE/port-craft) &mdash; abandoned :boom:
   - A project I took up to learn more about React ecosystem, but later started becoming so big and unmaintainable.
   - I learnt more about how medium-sized React applications are structured to scale...the hard way :anger:
   - I lost interest in the project because I didn't like the UI and the project idea was not something in the line of my interest.
   - I learnt a lot about React and I learnt mostly by trial and error, and consulting articles and docs online.
   - [Live Demo](https://ovecjoe.github.io/port-craft/) ([Alternative](https://portCraft.netlify.com/))
4. [Movie Lexicon](https://github.com/OVECJOE/movie-lexicon) &mdash; completed :heavy_check_mark:
   - Used IMDB API here to build a simple React application where users can get info about movies. (I am not a movie fan though)
   - Spent about 3 days working on it.
   - Used React purely. No routing functionality (maybe I could add that to it :thinking:)
   - [Live Demo](https://ovecjoe.github.io/movie-lexicon/)
5. [Tenzie Game](https://github.com/OVECJOE/tenzie-game) &mdash; Completed :heavy_check_mark: (assisted by Scrimba course)
   - This was a tutorial project from Scrimba React fundamentals crash course. I tweaked some things in it though.
   - Built using React
   - [Live Demo](https://ovecjoe.github.io/tenzie-game/)

#### Some of my projects (especially many from ALX Holberton) are not featured here yet for any of the following reasons:
- Not completed
- Not properly organized
- Laziness on my part :laughing:. Kidding though, but there are lots of optimizations and refactoring that need to be done to these repositories and this will take a while.
